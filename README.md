## Requirements

* Java 12 (AdoptOpenJDK)
* Grails 4.0.3+
* Gradle 6.5+

All of the above can be installed and easily maintained by using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/install).

## Applying the Plugin

The preferred way of running Mauro Data Mapper is using the [mdm-docker](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-docker) deployment. However you can
also run the backend on its own from [mdm-application-build](https://github.com/MauroDataMapper/mdm-application-build).

### mdm-docker

In the `docker-compose.yml` file add:

```yml
mauro-data-mapper:
    build:
        args:
            ADDITIONAL_PLUGINS: "uk.ac.ox.softeng.maurodatamapper.plugins:mdm-plugin-xsd:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

Please note, if adding more than one plugin, this is a semicolon-separated list

### mdm-application-build

In the `build.gradle` file add:

```groovy
grails {
    plugins {
        runtimeOnly 'uk.ac.ox.softeng.maurodatamapper.plugins:mdm-plugin-xsd:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}
```
